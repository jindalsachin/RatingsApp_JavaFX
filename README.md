# RatingsApp_JavaFX
Hey! 
This project is part of my second-year curriculum exercise and based on JavaFX.
JavaFX is a cross platform GUI toolkit for Java, and is the successor to the Java Swing libraries.

With this project I have built the UI in JavaFX and used data sets about Movies-TV shows, Articles, Novels&Books and Mobile Applications from Kaggle
and converted to SQL database using pandas Library in my Jupyter notebook.
After pre processing I connected the DbConnection.java file with all the DB and executed the SQL queries
and finally displayed & plotted the information.

On running application, you will have to Sign-In or Sign-Up (following the ss) 

<img src="/RatingApp/screenshots/signin.png" width="30%" />  <img src="/RatingApp/screenshots/signup.png" width="25%" />  <img src="/RatingApp/screenshots/the_office.png" width="30%" />  

The application contains options (as tabs) to choose among movies / books / articles / apps and search about them and extract the relevan information. 
It can also show the top 5 works (e.g movies) of an artists (e.g actors) and plot all their rating on side chart.
